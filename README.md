**Project Background**
--------------------

Lung cancer remains one of the most lethal cancers worldwide, with late diagnosis and lifestyle-related factors contributing significantly to mortality rates. This project aims to analyze a real-world dataset simulating lung cancer patient information, sourced from Kaggle, to uncover patterns, associations, and risk factors impacting patient outcomes.

**Insights are based on the following key areas:**
---------------------------------------------

🧬Demographic Risk Profiling : Identifying age groups and gender more prone to late-stage diagnoses and Assessing country-wise distribution to infer regional healthcare discrepancies.
📅 Diagnosis and Treatment Timelines : Exploring how the time between diagnosis and end of treatment affects survival and Investigate stage at diagnosis vs. treatment duration.
⚕️ Comorbidities and Medical History : How existing conditions (hypertension, asthma, etc) influence survival
🚬 Lifestyle and Behavioral Factors : Assess the impact of smoking status and bmi on cancer stage at diagnosis and treatment outcome.
🧪 Treatment Effectiveness : Compare survival rates across different treatment types.
